	<p>
		Kagame has made education for youth in Rwanda a high priority for his administration, allocating 17% of the annual budget to the sector. The Rwandan government provides free education in state-run schools for twelve years: six years in primary and six in secondary school. The final three years of free education were introduced in 2012 following a pledge by Kagame during his 2010 re-election campaign.Kagame credits his government with improvements in the tertiary education sector; the number of universities has risen from 1 in 1994 to 49 in 2022,and the tertiary gross enrollment ratio increased from 4% in 2008 to 18% in 2017.
	</p>
	<p>
		From 1994 until 2009, secondary education was offered in either French or English; since 2009, due to the country's increasing ties with the East African Community and the Commonwealth of Nations, English has been the sole language of instruction in public schools from primary school grade 4 onward.The country's literacy rate, defined as those aged 15 or over who can read and write, was 83% in 2020, up from 58% in 1991 and 38% in 1978.
	</p>

			<h2 id="jealth">Health</h2>
	<p>
		Rwanda's health profile was dominated by communicable diseases,including malaria, pneumonia, and HIV/AIDS. Prevalence and mortality rates have sharply declined in the past decade, but the short supply or unavailability of certain medicines continues to challenge disease management.
	</p>
	<p>
		Kagame's government improved this situation as one of the Vision 2020 priorities. It has increased funding, with the health budget up from 3.2% of national expenditure in 1996 to 10.4% in 2020. It also set up training institutes, including the Kigali Health Institute (KHI), and in 2008 effected laws making health insurance mandatory for all individuals; by 2019, over 98% of the population was covered.These policies have contributed to a steady increase in quality of healthcare and improvement in key indicators during Kagame's presidency.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2020, 14 children died before their fifth birthday for every 1000 live births, down from 163 under five deaths for every 1000 live births in 2006.Prevalence of some diseases have declined, including the eliminating maternal and neonatal tetanus and a sharp reduction in malaria morbidity, mortality rate, and specific lethality. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In response to shortages in qualified medical personnel, in 2011 the Rwandan government launched an eight-year US$151.8 million initiative to train medical professionals.
	</p>

			Kagame has garnered praise for the country's response to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the country having a relatively underdeveloped health care system, Rwanda has one of the lowest infection and mortality rates in the world, and is seen as a success story. Rwanda is currently the only nation in Africa whose residents are permitted to enter the Schengen Area for non essential travel. Rwanda's response has not been without its criticisms, in particular the curbing of civil liberties and individual freedoms. By August 2022. Rwanda was one of the few countries in Africa to have fully vaccinated over 80% of its population against COVID-19.
